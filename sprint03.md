## What are your thoughts about the roles HTML, CSS, and JavaScript play in the process of rendering content and providing user experience?

I'm old enough to remember the very first days of the web - Mosaic, dialup, having to fix TCP/IP issues. I was in the inaugural Student Technology Leadership Program (STLP) at my high school, where we learned extremely basic (yet, for the time, cutting-edge!) HTML.

There was an odd sort of magic to creating a simple text file in Notepad, adding these odd-looking angle bracket tags around parts of it, and then opening it in the browser to see it utterly transformed from plain text to an interactive web page - even if the interaction was limited to following hyperlinks from one static page to another. We learned how to make lists and tables. We learned how to apply rudimentary syling (italics, bold, etc.) in-line with our HTML.

Fast-forward about 25 years.

Modern HTML offers native capabilities we never dreamed of in our STLP meetings. And CSS and JavaScript take those capabilities to amazing new heights.
