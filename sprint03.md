## What are your thoughts about the roles HTML, CSS, and JavaScript play in the process of rendering content and providing user experience?

I'm old enough to remember the very first days of the web - Mosaic, dialup, having to fix TCP/IP issues. I was in the inaugural Student Technology Leadership Program (STLP) at my high school, where we learned extremely basic (yet, for the time, cutting-edge!) HTML.

There was an odd sort of magic to creating a simple text file in Notepad, adding these odd-looking angle bracket tags around parts of it, and then opening it in the browser to see it utterly transformed from plain text to an interactive web page - even if the interaction was limited to following hyperlinks from one static page to another. We learned how to make lists and tables. We learned how to apply rudimentary syling (italics, bold, etc.) in-line with our HTML.

Fast-forward about 25 years.

Modern HTML offers native capabilities we never dreamed of in our STLP meetings. And CSS and JavaScript take those capabilities to amazing new heights.

### HTML
Though far advanced from its earliest days, [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/) still at its most basic level is how programmers define the **structure** of a web page. I tend to think of it as the framing you might see on a new construction site.

### CSS
Once the framework is in place, [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/) allows us to define the look and feel of certain elements. Continuing the construction site analogy, this would be painting the interior, adding brick, etc.

### JS
For true interactivity, web developers can reach for [JavaScript](https://www.w3schools.com/js/). It allows elements throughout the website to respond to actions from users and change the content of the page accordingly. Once again with our construction site, this would be when the utilities (electricity, water, etc.) are turned on.
