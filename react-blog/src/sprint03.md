## What are your thoughts about the roles HTML, CSS, and JavaScript play in the process of rendering content and providing user experience?

I'm old enough to remember the very first days of the web - Mosaic, dialup, having to fix TCP/IP issues. I was in the inaugural Student Technology Leadership Program (STLP) at my high school, where we learned extremely basic (yet, for the time, cutting-edge!) HTML.

There was an odd sort of magic to creating a simple text file in Notepad, adding these odd-looking angle bracket tags around parts of it, and then opening it in the browser to see it utterly transformed from plain text to an interactive web page - even if the interaction was limited to following hyperlinks from one static page to another. We learned how to make lists and tables. We learned how to apply rudimentary syling (italics, bold, etc.) in-line with our HTML.

Fast-forward about 25 years.

Modern HTML offers native capabilities we never dreamed of in our STLP meetings. And CSS and JavaScript take those capabilities to amazing new heights.

### HTML
Though far advanced from its earliest days, [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/) still at its most basic level is how programmers define the **structure** of a web page. I tend to think of it as the framing you might see on a new construction site.

### CSS
Once the framework is in place, [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/) allows us to define the look and feel of certain elements. Continuing the construction site analogy, this would be painting the interior, adding brick, etc.

### JS
For true interactivity, web developers can reach for [JavaScript](https://www.w3schools.com/js/). It allows elements throughout the website to respond to actions from users and change the content of the page accordingly. Once again with our construction site, this would be when the utilities (electricity, water, etc.) are turned on.

## What are some objects that your blog incorporates?

I've kept my blog relatively simple thus far, writing everything in markdown. However even markdown supports some rudimentary objects.

- Interal Links
    - Internal hypertext links are easy to add in markdown and make it easier to navigate around different sections of a page of content.
- Tables
    - Tables are likewise easy to use and are a helpful way to organize and present information.
- Lists
    - Another alternative for displaying and organizing content.
- Images
    - Markdown facilitates the inclusion of images within pages to help better convey ideas or more visual elements.

For a more web-centric blog, HTML/CSS/JS offer many more advanced objects:

- Video
- Audio
- Multi-column layouts
- Advanced typography
- Dynamic interactive content
- Form elements for collection of information / subscriptions
- **And much more!**

## What are your thoughts on pseudocoding?

Pseudocoding accomplishes two important tasks.

### Thinking Programatically

First, the process of writing pseudocode for a given task forces one to slow down and approach the job pragmatically. Inputs have to be identified, as do underlying conditions that will play a role in the finished solution. The algorithm to be defined must be distilled down to its component parts. Functions and procedures, if possible, are separated out as individual pieces of the solution.

All the while, the writer has to try to **think** like a computer. Despite years of refinement of the individual components that make up a computer, the simple fact remains that even the fastest supercomputer still requires instructions to be fed in one at a time. Thus pseudocode fulfills a valuable role by forcing programmers to concentrate on taking a procedural approach to problem solving.

### Portability

With the pseudocode written programatically, yet not constrained to any one particular programming language, the next step in the process can begin. Well-defined and -structured pseudocode should be relatively easily translated into any given language.
