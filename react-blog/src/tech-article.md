# Five Ways to Become a Better Developer Using Pseudocode
## by Roger Mullins

Pseudocode - a human-readable description of the logic, variables and components to be used in a particular piece of software - can prevent a lot of issues during the development process. Here are five ways to put pseudocode to work for you.

### Copy Over the Design Specifications
Assuming your project has one, the first thing to do is copy in all of the design specifications into your pseudocode. This allows you to keep the client's requirements front and center during the design process. Depending on how the spec document is laid out, you might be able to convert it into an outline for your pseudocode. If it is more narrative in nature, take the time at the beginning to extract the salient information into outline form. It will keep you on track later, and allow you to notice opportunites for functions and features earlier in the design process.

### Summarize the Design Specifications in a MoSCoW Table
MoSCoW, a programmer acronym - and programmers love their acronyms - stands for your project's:
- Must haves
- Should haves
- Could haves, and
- Won't haves
It's a very visual way to create a quick reference point, and features can (and should) change columns during the design process as the client's wishes and your approach continue to evolve.

### Make a First Attempt at Identifying Functions and Variables

Sometimes these will be obvious, and other times they reveal themselves further along in the design process. Either way, it is invaluable to have them in a convenient list in your pseudocode document. Make notes regarding arguments or properties to be passed, and which components or functions will use them. Doing this will allow you to logically group your program's components when it comes time to actually write the code. This might even be a good time to write a UX walkthrough, describing as fully as possible what a typical user will see, want to do, and actually try to do with different portions of your software.

### Move Blocks of Pseudocode Around to Keep Things Sequential

By all means, write down things as they come to you. However, don't be afraid to pick up entire chunks of pseudocode and cut-and-paste it to another point in the design roadmap where it makes sense. Some features can't work without other features that will need to be created first, and the pseudocoding process is a relatively painless time to find that out.

### Keep it Language-Agnostic

Remember that pseudocode is not code. Strike a balance somewhere between full-on narrative and programming syntax. The idea is to create a map for yourself that you can then use to navigate any tech stack or programming paradigm you're faced with, and the more universal your pseudocode, the easier (and less painful) that process will be.
