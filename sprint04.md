## What was helpful during Onboarding working remotely?

Without hesitation I would say the Slack setup has been the most helpful element of remote work. The number of channels was initially somewhat overwhelming but the instructors did a commendable job explaining which channels were to be used for what content. It feels as though we already have a pretty solid sense of comradery as we head into the in-person section of the camp.

Along those same lines I appreciated the smaller team element as well. It was certainly helpful forging closer relationships with others starting this same journey.
