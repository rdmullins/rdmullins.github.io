## What was helpful during Onboarding working remotely?

Without hesitation I would say the Slack setup has been the most helpful element of remote work. The number of channels was initially somewhat overwhelming but the instructors did a commendable job explaining which channels were to be used for what content. It feels as though we already have a pretty solid sense of comradery as we head into the in-person section of the camp.

Along those same lines I appreciated the smaller team element as well. It was certainly helpful forging closer relationships with others starting this same journey.

## What hindered your progress during Onboarding?

I am what you would probably best call an 'old school' (literally in both words) student, used to sitting at a desk with my hardcover book and my notepad, taking longhand notes with my pen. So, a 'virtual classroom' definitely took some adjusting.

Luckily (?) we all undobutedly got some experience with these tools during the Covid-related shutdowns. I certainly did helping my daughters with their school work. So the tools, at least, were not entirely new to me. Still though it was undeniably a challenge to me trying to stay on top of all of the assigned readings and problems and generally juggling time management while continuing my full-time day job (which ended 9/15/22).

## How did you overcome challenges during Onboarding?

I think my personal strategy for overcoming challenges consisted of an odd mix of independence and dependence.

The '30 minute rule' for using the `help` channel on Slack was an excellent aid for this.

There have been several times throughout the past for weeks when I would find myself stuck on a logic issue and having to edit and otherwise refine my pseudocode to try and get a better grasp of the problem. Fortunately there are many excellent resources available and I was often able to indulge my independent streak and 'figure it out' on my own.

Likewise, there were a few instances where the 30 minute mark came and went and I realized I was no closer to a solution than when I began. (With several Gitpod issues, I was undoubtedly farther off course). In those times I felt free to reach out on the `help` channel and without fail someone, student or instructor, was able to help me out of the weeds.
