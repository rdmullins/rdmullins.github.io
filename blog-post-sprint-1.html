                    On a macro level, my single biggest challenge for the week was undoubtedly time 
                    management and struggling to find a rhythm that would work both
                    with the coursework and my family life. 

                    In terms of the concepts we covered, however, my biggest stumbling
                    block was wrapping my brain around state. It represents a huge paradigm
                    shift from the step-by-step linear programming model I learned the 
                    last time I took a high-level CS course.

                    Expanding on my <a href="#post-1">previous post</a>, I would like to spend
                    more time with state. I found myself during the <a href="https://rdmullins.github.io/mind-reader/index.html">Mind Reader</a> development
                    process thinking back to my final project in the Intro to Web Developing
                    course, <a href="https://pursuit-of-trivia.glitch.me/">Pursuit of Trivia</a>. While
                    I remain proud of what I put together using what we'd covered in class,
                    I definitely see potential to use state to cut down on the amount of traffic and
                    reloads required by the page.

                    Remote on-boarding served its purpose by 'easing' us in to the material
                    and giving room for occasional collaboration during standups or outside
                    stand-up time in Slack. There were definite inherent challenges; the 
                    biggest for me was trying to keep myself on task while reviewing the
                    material. 

                    In-person, by contrast, has helped immensely with the focus factor. In 
                    fact I feel almost as though I'm having to triage to determine
                    what is going to get my focus at a certain time.

                    The biggest difference, however, has been the level of collaboration
                    that comes with being in person. The model lends itself much better than
                    remote to our being able to help each other and learn from one anothers'
                    approaches.

                    I have practical and more abstract 'why's.

                    On the practical level, I made the decision to apply for Bootcamp because
                    my office of almost sixteen years was looking likely to close by year-end.
                    After they cut my pay (but not my hours) it made the decision that much
                    easier from a financial standpoint. Along those same lines, our daughters are
                    fast approaching college age - I'm not exactly at a point in life where I can
                    afford to go backwards salary-wise.

                    However there was definitely a deeper reason at play. After the Intro to
                    Web Design class ended back in the spring, I realized about a week later that
                    I really missed it. There was something about the web programming experience -
                    making something from nothing - that touched a creative side of myself that I 
                    had forgotten was there. 
                    
                    I'm looking forward to getting even deeper into the concepts we were able to
                    cover in the Intro class and I hope to continue to reestablish contact with the 
                    part of me that enjoys learning and building new things.
