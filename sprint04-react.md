## Do you think JavaScript Frameworks and Libraries are easy or hard to use? Why?

Having not used a framework, this post only takes into consideration the React library. React itself certainly has a learning curve, but the documentation for it is excellent. By referring back to the docs and working through the tutorials included, someone with at least a passing familiarity with JavaScript should be able to make use of a library like React.

## What Frameworks or Libraries are you interested in learning more about?

There are several. One in particular I have researched is npm's [markdown](https://www.npmjs.com/package/markdown) library, which allows for the conversion of markdown documents such as this one to HTML or JSX, thereby making it easier to import my older blog posts into the new (in progress) React-based version of my site.

## Find one emerging JavaScript tool that you would like to learn more about or use in your final project.

While I admit to the utility of Bootstrap, its inherent lack of customization can certainly be frustrating at times. One library I've been looking at more closely is [Lit](https://lit.dev/). It allows custom CSS in React-like components. One especially interesting feature is the ease with which CSS can be scoped within certain elements. It's also lightweight and highly portable across browsers.
