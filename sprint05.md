## What did you learn about that helped you understand the development process?

Several concepts we covered this week stand out to me.

### UX/UI Design

Whether or not 'we' as developers have a natural talent for design is beside the point, really, when you factor in that we're also all users. It's worthwhile to take a step back from the logic problem of a new assignment to imagine, first, what would constitute a pleasant user experience. I have found especially with pseudocoding that a quick walk-through of UX is invaluable for planning the structure and flow of the program itself.

### Pareto Principle

It's easy to get carried away adding features to a project, but the Pareto Principle reminds us of the law of diminishing returns. Rather than packing a project with a ton of cool features that will ultimately be ignored by 80% of the people actually using our product, we would be better served (as would be our end user) by polishing and perfecting the small sub-set that will actually be central to the user experience.
